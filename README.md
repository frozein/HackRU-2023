# HackRU-2023
Our entry for the Spring 2023 HackRU Hackathon, built in just 24 hours:

## FunnCards.com
An educational game designed to be highly customizable. Teachers are able to create a set of flashcards on the website, and then give the link to the flashcards to their students, who are then able to paste the link into the game and have a wide variety of games to play, all containing the custom questions made by the teacher.

### The Website
The website (see website/) was made by Akbar Pathan and Faisal Hossain. It uses a python backend with flask and sqlite for the database.

### The Game
The game (see game/) was made by Daniel Elwell. It was made in C++, with OpenGL for the rendering. It depends on FreeType, GLFW, and GLAD.
